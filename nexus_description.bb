Baldur's Gate 3 [color=#6d9eeb]Mod Configuration Menu[/color] ([color=#6d9eeb]MCM[/color]) provides an in-game menu through which mod users can configure mod settings and hotkeys.[/b]
It is a central location for mod configuration and can be accessed via the main and ESC menus, or pressing the [i]Insert[/i] key (by default).[/size][size=3]

[size=2]Are you a mod author? Check the [url=https://wiki.bg3.community/Tutorials/Mod-Frameworks/mod-configuration-menu]documentation for integrating mods with the MCM[/url]; it's a simple process and there are a lot of author-facing features you definitely want to hear about![/size]
[/size]
[center][size=3]Here's [b][color=#6d9eeb]MCM 1.33[/color][/b] in action with several mods, showcasing profiles, keybindings, and mod pages:[/size]

[size=3][b]If you'd like to support MCM and my other mods, consider supporting me on Patreon; every bit helps!
[/b][/size][/b][size=3][size=3]Consider politely asking authors of mods that use Script Extender to integrate with MCM![/size][/size][b][url=https://patreon.com/Volitio?utm_source=join_link&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator]

[list]
[*][b]Easily configure mods[/b]: MCM provides a simple and intuitive way to change mods' settings. No need to manually edit JSON files - although still allowed, just like in the old days!
[*] [b]Instant setting saving and loading[/b]: Unlike the traditional way of handling settings, MCM-integrated settings update in real-time as they are changed, without requiring save reloads or SE commands;
[*][b]Load order health checking[/b]: MCM also checks your load order for missing/outdated dependencies and mods with invalid UUIDs.
[*][b]Keybinding management[/b]: easily assign keyboard bindings directly from the MCM window, with built-in conflict handling.
[*][b]UI agnostic[/b]: MCM's core configuration code is designed to work independently of IMGUI. This means that even if IMGUI support were to be completely removed, MCM would still work. [b]Users who can't see the current UI will still be able to use MCM's under-the-hood benefits to manage their settings, and also edit them through JSON files[/b].
[*] [b]Save-safe[/b]: MCM does not write anything to your save files - all modifications are done in-memory and then saved to JSON files. MCM can also be safely uninstalled without affecting your save files at any time, provided any mods that use it are disabled or uninstalled as well;
[*] [b]Multiple profiles[/b]: MCM allows you to manage multiple configuration profiles, so you can have different settings for different playthroughs/characters;
[*] [b]Reduced user error[/b]: MCM performs several settings validations, reducing the risk of user error when configuring mods, even if manually editing JSON files;
[*] [b]Export and import settings[/b]: Mod settings are stored per-profile and per-mod JSON files under [font=Courier New]Script Extender\BG3MCM[/font], making it easy to create backups and restore settings.
[*] [b]Uncluttered UI[/b]: MCM consolidates all mod settings into one interface, reducing screen clutter.
[*] [b]Robust[/b]: MCM has dozens of automated tests to ensure it works as expected, without halting;
[*] [b]Localization support[/b]: MCM allows you to view settings in your preferred language, if translations are provided by mod authors/translators;

[b][size=3]Installation is the same as any other pak mod[/size][/b] and can be performed with new and existing saves:
[list=1]
[*]In [url=https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager]Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager[/url], (or use Vortex at your own discretion), install/enable the Script Extender (SE) by clicking on the 'Tools' tab at the top left of the program and selecting 'Download and Extract the Script Extender'. [b]Alternatively,[size=2][size=2]Â press CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+T while BG3MM's window is focused;[/size][/size][/b]
[*]Import this mod's .zip file into the Mod Manager, then drag the mod from the right panel of the Mod Manager to the left panel; make sure to [b]drag it to the top of your load order[/b], as it needs to be placed above any mods that rely on this framework;
[*]Save and export your load order. MCM will now automatically pick up and be available to any mods that may use it.
[/list]
[size=3]You should then see a button for MCM in the ESC menu in-game. It can also be opened with the INSERT key by default.[b]
[/b]You may also update MCM at any point[/size][size=4], unless stated otherwise.Â [/size][b]

UI/IMGUI support in SE has been significantly improved since launch, but you may still face some issues that are beyond my control.[/b] If you don't see the MCM window, you can try these things:
[list=1]
[*]restart your game ([color=#e06666][b]don't alt-tab before reaching the main menu[/b][/color]);
[*]disable overlays (Discord/AMD/NVIDIA/OBS/etc);
[*]toggle the rendering API to Vulkan/DX11.
[*]verify that the problem persists with no other DLL mods, such as WASD movement;
[*]delete the [b]imgui.ini[/b] file at [i]AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\imgui.ini[/i]
[*]if you disabled SE autoupdates or are using the Devel channel and having problems, please switch back.
[/list]
[color=#6aa84f][size=4][b]Even if you have issues with IMGUI, MCM will continue working as a config/JSON manager in the background if its window does not appear.[/b][/size][/color][line]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/DpLvnqC.png[/img]
[size=3]MCM 1.30+ greatly improved multiplayer compatibility. If you still face problems, however, let the host manage settings. Connecting players do not need to have the same MCM settings to engage in multiplayer.

Similar to my experience with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8295]ISF[/url], I'd like to thank the foundational work of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/21094599]Focus[/url]ï»¿ and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/244952?tab=user+files]Nells[/url]ï»¿/[url=https://github.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/]Community Library team[/url]. While applied to a lesser extent in this context, their insights throughout ISF have made this endeavor a much less daunting task. I will be forever grateful for their open-source contributions to the Baldur's Gate 3 modding scene. Of course, none of this would be possible without the work put into Script Extender & LSLib by [url=https://github.com/Norbyte/]Norbyte[/url]ï»¿ and his responsiveness to feedback and troubleshooting. It was a pleasure working asynchronously with you, gentlemen ðŸŽ©ðŸ‘Œ.
Also, a shoutout to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/64167336?tab=user+files]Fallen[/url] for alpha testing this mod, to [url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/skiz/mods?gameId=3474]Skiz[/url] for being in the IMGUI trenches with me, to [url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Aahz07/about-me?gameId=3474]Aahz[/url] for some help with sidebar design and implementation (also [url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/osirisofinternet/mods?gameId=3474]osirisofinternet[/url]) with detaching windows, state management involving client-side UI (adapting ReactiveX for SE, etc), and porting vanilla icons for usage inside IMGUI, to the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21497]F4MCM[/url] team for inspiration, to [url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/MattifusP/]MattifusP[/url]ï»¿Â and [url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Valeriede]Valeriede[/url] for the contributions on GitHub and to many many others in the modding community that shared support and/or donated!
